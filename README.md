## Demo
Check out Edu Chatbot in action: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/nDMpLLQesEk)

To help you understand what's happening in the demo video, below is a write-up to illustrate the complete interaction flow:
```text
The flow begins when a customer inquires about courses through a chatbot. The chatbot classifies the intent and gathers key information such as the student's age and interests. Based on the inputs, it recommends suitable courses along with details like descriptions, teacher profiles, pricing, and schedules. When the customer expresses concern about the price and requests a discount, the chatbot informs them it isn't authorized to offer one. A support staff monitoring the conversation then intervenes by clicking a "Take Over" button and offers a special discount. The customer accepts, and the staff hands the conversation back to the chatbot, which proceeds with enrollment, completing the interaction smoothly.
```


## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
* Python version 3.12+
* Docker Desktop

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jeanetted3v/edu_chatbot.git
cd edu-chatbot
```
2. Configure environmental variables
* Key variables you need: at least 1 LLM api key and a MongoDB URI
* For the rest, you can put in placeholders such as "api_key" so that the system can still run. 
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your API keys and configurations
```


### Data Configuration - Local
* Place your unstructured FAQ documents (PDF) and structured data Excel files in the /data/data_to_ingest folder
* In config/data_ingest.yaml, configure the paths under "local_docs" according to the file names and excel sheet names
* Currently only support text information.
```yaml
local_doc:
  paths:
    - path: ./data/data_to_ingest/excel.xlsx
      sheet: syn_data
    - path: ./data/data_to_ingest/rag_qna.pdf
```

```yaml
embedder:
  similarity_metric: cosine
  persist_dir: ./data/embeddings
  collection: syn_data
  vector_store: chromadb
```

### Data Configuration - Gdrive (Temporarily disabled)
* Or configure Google Drive access
* Generate and download Google Drive API credentials JSON file
* Place your credentials file in a secure location
* In config/data_ingest.yaml, configure the Google Drive settings:
```yaml
gdrive:
  credentials_path: /path/to/your/credentials.json   # Path to your Google API credentials JSON file
gdrive_doc:
  - file_id: abcd123efg456                           # ID from Google Sheets URL
    file_type: sheets                                # For Google Sheets documents
  - file_id: abcd123efg456                           # ID from Google Docs URL
    file_type: docs                                  # For Google Docs documents
  # - file_id: your_drive_pdf_file_id_here
  #   file_type: pdf   # Support for PDF files (coming soon)

## Technical Implementation Details
**<span style="color:#4285F4">📏 RAG or Long Context?</span>**
- In view of recent advancement in LLM's context window, this chatbot is set up to use LLM to retreive information if data is within a certain token count. If token count is over a certain number, we'll fall back to use RAG instead. 
- Token count is set as a configurable parameter in config/data_ingest.yaml

**<span style="color:#0F9D58">📂 Loading documents from Local or Google Drive</span>**
- Education company can either load data into Google Drive or locally for both structured and unstructured data ingestion.
- This can be configured in config/data_ingest.yaml

**<span style="color:#F4B400">✂️ Chunking</span>**
- Various chunking strategies are configurable in the config/data_ingest.yaml file. 
- Currently Langchain is used for RecursiveCharacter and SemanticChunker chunking stratgies for the RAG pipeline.

**<span style="color:#DB4437">🔍 Embedding, Vector Database & Retrieval</span>**
- Implements ChromaDB for lightweight, high-performance vector storage.
- Utilizes BM25 for efficient full-text keyword search, enabling robust lexical matching alongside semantic retrieval.
- Applies CrossEncoder as a reranker to refine and boost relevance of retrieved results through deeper contextual scoring.

**<span style="color:#9C27B0">🤖 Modular Agentic RAG</span>**
- PydanticAI is used here for its simplicity and data valiadation feature.
- Also implemented PydanticAI logfire for LLM tracing.
- Able to provide a more deterministic structured output, such as during intent classification process. 
- For other LLM functions, plain vanilla OpenAI API is used for simplicity and flexibility. 
- Incorporates a separate **Reasoning Agent** to elaborate on incoming query, assess whether the intent needs to be split into multiple intent and thus retrieval, and determine if RAG is required.
* A **Response Agent** then synthesizes incoming query, chat history, and any retrieved documents to generate the final customer response. This modular approach optimizes latency, reduces unnecessary retrieval calls, and improves the relevance and coherence of responses.

**<span style="color:#FF9800">💾 Saved Chat History</span>**
- All chat histories are saved in MongoDB, which allows for tracing, further analysis and prompt enhancements.

<span style="color:#E91E63">📊 Evaluation</span>
- Ragas: Metrics include answer relevancy, faithfulness, context precision, answer correctness.
- DeepEval: Conversational metrics are also used here since it involves multi-turn conversations.
- Evaluation results are logged for continuous improvement of the system.


## Ideas for Future Enhancements
1. **Multi-Channel Integration**
- Implement direct integration with WhatsApp, WeChat, Telegram, and other messaging platforms
- Develop a unified API layer for consistent experience across all communication channels
- Enable channel-specific customizations while maintaining core functionality

2. **Vector Database**
- To support more types of vector database

3. **MultiModal data**
- To support MultiModal data RAG

4. **Enhanced Evaluation**
- To add customized evaluation metrics
