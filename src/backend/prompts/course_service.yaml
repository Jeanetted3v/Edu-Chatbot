  Given these student interests: {', '.join(interests)}

  And these available courses:
  {'-' * 40}
  {'\n'.join(course_contexts)}
  {'-' * 40}

  For each course, determine how well it matches the student's interests.
  Consider both direct matches and related concepts (e.g., 'comprehension' relates to 'reading', 
  'problem solving' relates to 'mathematics').

  Return your response as a JSON array of objects with course indices (0-based) and match scores (0.0-1.0).
  Only include courses with match score > 0.3.
  Example format:
  [
      {{"index": 0, "score": 0.9, "reason": "Strong match because..."}},
      {{"index": 2, "score": 0.7, "reason": "Related to interest because..."}}
  ]
